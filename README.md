# Checking the Functionality

## This module includes functions to facilitate communication with a device by generating request messages and parsing response messages. It provides three main functions: generate_request_message, parse_din_status_response, and din_status_to_32bit_signed_integer. These functions ensure the interaction with the device adheres to the specified communication protocol.

## Generate Request Message
To verify the generate_request_message function, provide an integer command number as input. The function will output a request message byte string. Ensure the command number is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. The generated byte string should be in the correct format, combining the message ID, command number, and a checksum.

## Parse DIN Status Response
For the parse_din_status_response function, input a response message byte string that represents the DIN status. The function extracts and returns the status of each contact as an array of integer values. Check that the output array correctly reflects the binary representation of the DIN status in the response message.

## Convert DIN Status to 32-bit Signed Integer
To test the din_status_to_32bit_signed_integer function, input an array of integer values representing the DIN status. The function converts this array into a 32-bit signed integer. Ensure the input array length is within 32 bits and verify the output integer accurately represents the combined bit values, taking into account the sign bit and ensuring it is within the 32-bit signed integer range.

By following these steps, you can confirm that each function performs as expected, facilitating effective communication with the device.
